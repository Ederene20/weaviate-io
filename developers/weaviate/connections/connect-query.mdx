The Weaviate Cloud (WCD) [query application (query app)](/developers/wcs/console) is a browser-based GraphQL IDE. Use the query app to work interactively with your WCD clusters.

## Open the query app

To use the query app, open your [WCD Dashboard](https://console.weaviate.cloud).

In the left-hand menu, click the Query app icon.

## Select a Weaviate instance

The query app connects directly to your WCD clusters. The query app can also connect to other Weaviate instances if you have anonymous access enabled.

To select a cluster, Click the `Query` button and choose a cluster from the clusters list.

### Authentication

The query app connects to WCD instances without any additional authentication details. It connects to external clusters if anonymous access is enabled.

### Pass inference keys

To pass API keys for inference modules such as `text2vec-cohere`, `text2vec-cohere`, or `text2vec-openai`, use request headers.

The header can pass multiple keys.

```shell
{
 "X-Cohere-Api-key": "replaceWithYourCohereKey",
 "X-HuggingFace-Api-key": "replaceWithYourHuggingFaceKey",
 "X-OpenAI-Api-key": "replaceWithYourOpenAIKey",
}
```
