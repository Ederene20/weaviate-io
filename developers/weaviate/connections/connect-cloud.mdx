Use [client libraries](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries) or a tool such as cURL to connect to Weaviate Cloud (WCD).

## Retrieve your API keys

The Weaviate client libraries use API keys to authenticate to WCD instances.

import RetrieveAPIKeys from '/_includes/wcs/retrieve-api-keys.mdx';

<RetrieveAPIKeys/>

## Connection example

To connect, set the environment variables and edit this code to match your environment.

import WCDAuthenticationApiKey from '/_includes/code/wcs/wcs.authentication.mdx';

<WCDAuthenticationApiKey/>

## Third party API keys

Integrations that use external APIs often need API keys for those services. To add third party API keys, follow these examples:

<WCDAuthAndInferenceKeys/>

## Environment variables

Do not hard-code API keys in your client code. Consider using environment variables or a similar secure coding technique instead.

To create an environment variable, add a line like this example to your shell configuration file.

```bash
export WEAVIATE_API_KEY="replaceThisPartWithYourWeaviateAPIKey"
```
