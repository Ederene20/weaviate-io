<RetrieveAPIKeys/>

## Connection example

To connect, set the environment variables and edit this code to match your environment.

import WCDAuthenticationApiKey from '/_includes/code/wcs/wcs.authentication.mdx';

<WCDAuthenticationApiKey/>

## Third party API keys

Integrations that use external APIs often need API keys for those services. The Weaviate clients send third party API keys as headers.

To add third party API keys, follow these examples:

<WCDAuthAndInferenceKeys/>

## Environment variables

Do not hard-code your API key in your client code. Consider passing the API key as an environment variable or using a similar secure coding technique.

To create an environment variable, add a line like this example to your shell configuration file.

```bash
export WEAVIATE_API_KEY="replaceThisPartWithYourWeaviateAPIKey"
```
