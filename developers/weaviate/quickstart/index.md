## Create a Weaviate instance

Go to the [WCS Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud), and create an instance as described [here](/developers/weaviate/installation/weaviate-cloud-services). Make sure to collect the **API key** and **URL** from the <kbd>Details</kbd> tab.

<details>
  <summary>Can I use Docker for this quickstart?</summary>

  <p>Yes. You can also use Docker.</p>

  <p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Download <a href="https://configuration.weaviate.io/v2/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml?generative_cohere=false&generative_openai=true&generative_openai_key_approval=yes&generative_palm=false&media_type=text&modules=modules&ner_module=false&openai_key_approval=yes&qna_module=false&ref2vec_centroid=false&reranker_cohere=false&runtime=docker-compose&spellcheck_module=false&sum_module=false&text_module=text2vec-openai&weaviate_version=v1.20.5" target="_blank">this</a> Docker-compose file.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run the following command: <code>$ docker-compose up -d</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          The end-point you will use later is <code>http://localhost:8080</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </p>

</details>

## Install a client library

We suggest using a [Weaviate client](../client-libraries/index.md). To install your preferred client <i class="fa-solid fa-down"></i>:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart.clients.install.mdx';

:::info Install client libraries

<CodeClientInstall />

:::

<hr/>

## Connect to Weaviate

import ConnectToWeaviateWithKey from '/_includes/code/installation.connect.withkey.mdx'

<ConnectToWeaviateWithKey />

If you use Docker, you don't have to provide an API-key.

<hr/>

## Define a class

Next, we define a data collection (a "class" in Weaviate) to store objects in:

import CodeAutoschemaMinimumSchema from '/_includes/code/quickstart.autoschema.minimum.schema.mdx'

<CodeAutoschemaMinimumSchema />

This creates a class `Question`. â€‹Setting the vectorizer is optional. It's a Weaviate module (in this case `text2vec-openai`) that Weaviate uses to generate embeddings when storing or quering data.

Now you are ready to add objects to Weaviate.

<hr/>

## Add a single object

We will upload a single data object with an embedding from OpenAI's ada model.

import CodeAutoschemaImportSingleCustomVectors from '/_includes/code/quickstart.autoschema.import.single.custom.vectors.mdx'

<CodeAutoschemaImportSingleCustomVectors />

## Add objects in a batch

We'll add objects to our Weaviate instance using a **batch import** process.

<details>
  <summary>Why use batch imports?</summary>

Batch imports provide significantly improved import performance, so you should almost always use batch imports unless you have a good reason not to, such as single object creation.

</details>

import CodeAutoschemaImportCustomVectors from '/_includes/code/quickstart.autoschema.import.custom.vectors.mdx'

<CodeAutoschemaImportCustomVectors />

<details>
  <summary>Custom vectors with a <code>vectorizer</code></summary>

Note that you can specify a `vectorizer` and still provide a custom vector. In this scenario, make sure that the vector comes from the same model as one specified in the `vectorizer`. <p><br/></p>

In this tutorial, they come from OpenAI's Ada2 model - the same as specified in the vectorizer configuration.

</details>

:::tip vector != object property
Do *not* specify object vectors as an object property. This will cause Weaviate to treat it as a regular property, rather than as a vector embedding.
:::

<hr/>

# Putting it together

The following code puts the above steps together. You can run it yourself to import the data into your Weaviate instance.

<details>
  <summary>End-to-end code</summary>

:::tip Remember to replace the **URL**, **Weaviate API key** and **inference API key**
:::

import CodeAutoschemaEndToEnd from '/_includes/code/quickstart.autoschema.endtoend.mdx'

<CodeAutoschemaEndToEnd />

Congratulations, you've successfully built a vector database!

</details>

<hr/>

## Queries

Now, we can run queries!

### Vector search

This is a pure vector search, it takes an embedding as input and conducts a similarity search. This is ideal if you generate your embeddings outside of Weaviate.

import CodeAutoschemaPureVector from '/_includes/code/quickstart.autoschema.purevector.mdx'

<CodeAutoschemaPureVector />

### Vector search with a filter

...

### Semantic search

From now on we will need the OpenAI API-key because Weaviate will interact directly with the model.

Let's try a similarity search. We'll use `nearText` search to look for quiz objects most similar to `biology`.

import CodeAutoschemaNeartext from '/_includes/code/quickstart.autoschema.neartext.mdx'

<CodeAutoschemaNeartext />

You should see a result like this (these may vary per module/model used):

import BiologyQuestionsJson from '/_includes/code/quickstart.biology.questions.mdx'

<BiologyQuestionsJson />

The response includes a list of top 2 (due to the `limit` set) objects whose vectors are most similar to the word `biology`.

:::tip Why is this useful?
Notice that even though the word `biology` does not appear anywhere, Weaviate returns biology-related entries.

This example shows why vector searches are powerful. Vectorized data objects allow for searches based on degrees of similarity, as shown here.
:::

### Semantic search with a filter

You can add a Boolean filter to your example. For example, let's run the same search, but only look in objects that have a "category" value of "ANIMALS".

import CodeAutoschemaNeartextWithWhere from '/_includes/code/quickstart.autoschema.neartext.where.mdx'

<CodeAutoschemaNeartextWithWhere />

You should see a result like this (these may vary per module/model used):

import BiologyQuestionsWhereJson from '/_includes/code/quickstart.biology.where.questions.mdx'

<BiologyQuestionsWhereJson />

The response includes a list of top 2 (due to the `limit` set) objects whose vectors are most similar to the word `biology` - but only from the "ANIMALS" category.

:::tip Why is this useful?
Using a Boolean filter allows you to combine the flexibility of vector search with the precision of `where` filters.
:::


<!-- Note: Added the generative search example; but hiding it for now as it makes the workflow quite difficult for new users. 1) They will now need an OpenAI/Cohere key. 2) The schema needs to include a generative module definition. 3) Rate limit on generative API is low; so might be painful. -->

<!-- ### Generative search

Now let's try a generative search. We'll retrieve a set of results just as we did above, before using an LLM to explain each answer in plain terms.

import CodeAutoschemaGenerative from '/_includes/code/quickstart.autoschema.generativesearch.mdx'

<CodeAutoschemaGenerative />

You should see a result like this (may vary depending on the model used):

import BiologyGenerativeSearchJson from '/_includes/code/quickstart.biology.generativesearch.mdx'

<BiologyGenerativeSearchJson />

Here, we see that Weaviate has retrieved the same results as before. But now it includes an additional, generated text with a plain-language explanation of each answer.

:::tip Why is this useful?
Generative search sends retrieved data from Weaviate to a large language model (LLM). This allows you to go beyond simple data retrieval, but transform the data into a more useful form, without ever leaving Weaviate.

### Question Answering

## Recap

Well done! You have:
- Created your own cloud-based vector database with Weaviate,
- Populated it with data objects,
    - Using an inference API, or
    - Using custom vectors,
- Performed text similarity searches.

Where next is up to you. We include a few links below - or you can check out the sidebar.

<!-- TODO - Provide a few concrete "intermediate" learning paths -->

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

We provide answers to some common questions, or potential issues below.

#### How to confirm class creation

<details>
  <summary>See answer</summary>

If you are not sure whether the class has been created, you can confirm it by visiting the [`schema` endpoint](../api/rest/schema.md) here (replace the URL with your actual endpoint):

```
https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network/v1/schema
```

You should see:

```json
{
    "classes": [
        {
            "class": "Question",
            ...  // truncated additional information here
            "vectorizer": "text2vec-huggingface"
        }
    ]
}
```

Where the schema should indicate that the `Question` class has been added.

:::note REST & GraphQL in Weaviate
Weaviate uses a combination of RESTful and GraphQL APIs. In Weaviate, RESTful API endpoints can be used to add data or obtain information about the Weaviate instance, and the GraphQL interface to retrieve data.
:::

</details>

#### If you see <code>Error: Name 'Question' already used as a name for an Object class</code>

<details>
  <summary>See answer</summary>

You may see this error if you try to create a class that already exists in your instance of Weaviate. In this case, you can delete the class following the below instructions.

import CautionSchemaDeleteClass from '/_includes/schema-delete-class.mdx'

<CautionSchemaDeleteClass />

</details>

#### How to confirm data import

<details>
  <summary>See answer</summary>

To confirm successful data import, navigate to the [`objects` endpoint](../api/rest/objects.md) to check that all objects have been imported (replace with your actual endpoint):

```
https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network/v1/objects
```

You should see:

```json
{
    "deprecations": null,
    "objects": [
        ...  // Details of each object
    ],
    "totalResults": 10  // You should see 10 results here
}
```

Where you should be able to confirm that you have imported all `10` objects.

</details>

#### If the `nearText` search is not working

<details>
  <summary>See answer</summary>

To perform text-based (`nearText`) similarity searches, you need to have a vectorizer enabled, and configured in your class.

Make sure you configured it as shown in [this section](#define-a-class).

If it still doesn't work - please [reach out to us](#more-resources)!
